####Lease My Home Back
Lease My Home Back was a product of Homeowner Toolbox that helped financially struggling homeowners find an alternative to losing their homes to foreclosure.

####My Role
I was asked to design and build a very basic HTML layout for the website. I used Illustrator to design the layout and Notepad++ to code. I also created the video seen on the site using Illustrator and AfterEffects.
