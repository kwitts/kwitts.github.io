####HOTB Software Solutions
HOTB Software is a software development company whose software is used by a number of private sector organizations, hundreds of State Government personnel, over a thousand nonprofit counseling agencies, and thousands of nonprofit housing counselors.

####My Role
I designed the site and built it using HTML5/CSS3 and Javascript/JQuery. I used Illustrator to design the layout and Notepad++ to code.
