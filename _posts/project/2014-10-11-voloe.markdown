####Voloe
Voloe is an online network designed to help you make a list to then share with friends and family.

####My Role
I designed, built, and continue to enhance the experience of the entire website. With HTML5/CSS3, Javascript/JQuery, and team of amazing back-end developers, the site is a growing community of dreamers with goals. I also designed all graphics, including the logo. Designed and built entirely seperate website for mobile devices (web app) using the same technologies, which can be found at <a href="http://m.voloe.com">http://m.voloe.com</a>

####Technology Used
Illustrator &bull; HTML5/CSS3 &bull; Javascript/jQuery &bull; Facebook APIs &bull; Visual Studio &amp; TFS &bull; Sharepoint &bull; Web Application
