            <h4>More About Me</h4>
            <p>My name is Kristi Witts. I was born and raised in southern NJ and Philadelphia, lived in Phoenix, AZ for a few years, and now Iâ€™m living in Orange County, CA. I am currently a <strong>front-end web developer</strong> for HOTB Software and a <strong>freelance UI/UX designer and full-stack developer</strong>. Outside of my day-job and freelance, I spend my free time drawing, working on my various pet projects, playing video games, reading, writing, crocheting, cooking, hiking, and watching cartoons with my husband and our cats.</p>
            <p>I have always had a fascination with the internet, particularly how websites are made, since I got my first computer. I taught myself how to code in HTML4 and XHTML when I was just 11 years old (thankfully, none of those early websites still exist). Combined with my love for both art and development, my first website was a portfolio of my drawings. If you're into that, you can see my current artwork portfolio site/blog <a href="http://kristiwitts.com">here</a>.</p>
            <p>I received my BA in Media Arts in 2011. I worked on numerous graphic design and web development projects before deciding to pursue my passion for development further in 2012. I've worked on several large-scale websites and web applications in the past 4 years and many small business websites in the past 6 years.  </p>
